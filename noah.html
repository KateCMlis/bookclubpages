        <p>Noah's path from apartheid South Africa to the desk of The Daily Show began with a criminal act: his birth. 
            Born to a white Swiss father and a black Xhosa mother, at the time such a union was punishable by five years in prison.
            <br><br>
            As he struggles to find himself in a world where he was never supposed to exist, his mother is determined to save her 
            son from the cycle of poverty, violence, and abuse that would ultimately threaten her own life. With an incisive wit 
            and unflinching honesty, Noah weaves together a moving yet funny portrait of a boy making his way through a damaged 
            world in a dangerous time.</p>

                <b>ABOUT TREVOR NOAH</b>
                <br>
                <br>
                Trevor Noah is a comedian, TV personality, and author. His work includes hosting the Comedy Central satirical news program 
                The Daily Show between 2015-2022, comedy specials recorded for Netflix and the Comedy Central Network, and hosting the White 
                House Correspondents' Dinner in 2022, and a well-received memoir published in 2016. 
                <br>
                <br>
                He has also performed stand-up comedy for audiences all over the world. Trevor Noah was born in 1984 in South Africa. His mother was a Xhosa woman, and his father, a white 
                European which meant at the time of his birth, Noah's parents' relationship was illegal under South Africa's apartheid laws. 
                Born in the last years of  apartheid rule, Trevor Noah's early childhood experiences were shaped by the challenges of an interracial 
                famly in a country with mandatory legal segregation. His writing and performance often explore the themes of living as a person of mixed heritage.

        <h2 class="headerstyle">Discussion Questions</h2>
        <ol class="question-list">
            <li>Did you know anything about apartheid in South Africa before reading this book? Noah opens his memoir with the 1927 Immorality Act, which made sexual relationships between people of different racial groups illegal. Did his choice to do that affect your understanding of what apartheid was and how it worked?</li>
            <li>Trevor’s mother is a Xhosa woman, and his father a white Swiss-German man. His birth was evidence of an illegal act under South African law at the time. What could the consequences of Trevor's birth have been for him? For his mother? For his father? How did his mother navigate raising a mixed-race son before the apartheid laws were abolished in South Africa?</li>
            <li>Trevor Noah speaks multiple languages. How does this ability create opportunities for Trevor in the course of the book? How does he describe language a barrier or limiter for South Africans? Did the government benefit from citizens not being able to communicate with one another?</li>
            <li>In the first chapter of the book, Trevor's mother throws him from a moving minibus in order to avoid being attacked by its driver. The book ends with Noah recounting an incident of domestic violence by his step-father. Abel. How does violence on personal and societal levels affect Trevor's life throughout the course of the book?</li>
            <li>Trevor’s skin color affected his upbringing in many ways, including how he was or was not disciplined. Why did Trevor’s grandmother refuse to discipline him? How did Trevor escape identification as one of the culprits in a robbery caught on tape?</li>
            <li>Why are people, particularly white people, outraged by the incident at the soccer match? How do you think people of different cultures and in different locations perceive this incident? Why is Trevor surprised by this outraged response? Why do you think videos of black people being beaten to death by white people in South Africa do not provoke the same public outcry?</li>
            <li>How did receiving computer equipment from a white friend impact Trevor’s music business? How does this influence his understanding about the need to “empower the dispossessed and the disenfranchised in the wake of oppression”?</li>
            <li>Why do the police refuse to charge Abel with any crimes when Trevor’s mother reports him for abuse? How do the police treat Trevor’s mother? Were you surprised to read about this kind of response to domestic violence? Why or why not?</li>
            <li>Why does Trevor’s mother refer to the effects of growing up poor and black as “the black tax”? How does the "black tax affect the lives of Black South Africans? How does Noah's mother raise him to think about that tax?</li>
