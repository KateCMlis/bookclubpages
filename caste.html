            In this book, Isabel Wilkerson gives us a portrait of an unseen phenomenon 
            in America as she explores, through an immersive, deeply researched narrative and stories about real people, how America 
            today and throughout its history has been shaped by a hidden caste system, a rigid hierarchy of human rankings. Beyond race, 
            class, or other factors, there is a powerful caste system that influences people's lives and behavior and the nation's fate. 
            Linking the caste systems of America, India, and Nazi Germany, Wilkerson explores eight pillars that underlie caste systems 
            across civilizations, including divine will, bloodlines, stigma, and more.
        </p> 
        <p>    
            Using riveting stories about people--including Martin 
            Luther King, Jr., baseball's Satchel Paige, a single father and his toddler son, Wilkerson herself, and many others--she shows 
            the ways that the insidious undertow of caste is experienced every day. She documents how the Nazis studied the racial systems 
            in America to plan their out-cast of the Jews; she discusses why the cruel logic of caste requires that there be a bottom rung 
            for those in the middle to measure themselves against; she writes about the surprising health costs of caste, in depression and 
            life expectancy, and the effects of this hierarchy on our culture and politics. Finally, she points forward to ways America 
            can move beyond the artificial and destructive separations of human divisions, toward hope in our common humanity

                <b>ABOUT ISABEL WILKERSON</b>
        </p>
                <p>
                    Isabel Wilkerson was born in Washington, D.C. She received a bachelor's degree in journalism from Howard University. 
                    She won the Pulitzer Prize for her work as Chicago Bureau Chief of The New York Times in 1994, making her the first black 
                    woman in the history of American journalism to win a Pulitzer Prize and the first African-American to win for individual 
                    reporting. She also won the George Polk Award, a John Simon Guggenheim Fellowship, and she was named Journalist of the Year 
                    by the National Association of Black Journalists.

                    Her first book, <i>The Warmth of Other Suns: The Epic Story of America's Great Migration</i>, won the 2010 National Book Critics Circle 
                    Award for Nonfiction, the 2011 Anisfield-Wolf Award for Nonfiction, the 2011 Hillman Book Prize, the 2011 Heartland Prize for 
                    Nonfiction, the Stephen Ambrose Oral History Prize, the Independent Literary Award for Nonfiction, and the NAACP Image Award for 
                    best literary debut. She has been a journalism professor at Princeton University and Emory University. She is currently Professor 
                    of Journalism and Director of Narrative Nonfiction at Boston University.

        <h2 class="headerstyle">Discussion Questions</h2>
        <ol class="question-list">
            <li>What was your understanding of the term <i>caste</i> before you began this book? </li>
            <li>“Before there was a United States of America,” Wilkerson writes, “there was a caste system, born in colonial Virginia.” How can 
                Americans reckon with this fact? What does it mean to you to live in a country whose system of discrimination was cemented 
                before the country itself?</li>
            <li>Did learning about the lens and language of caste change the way you look at U.S. history and society? How?</li>
            <li>Caste and race are not the same thing. What is the difference between the two? How do casteism and racism support each other? How is class 
                also different from caste?</li>
            <li>Wilkerson frequently uses her own experience as an African-American woman to illustrate her points regarding caste—including the experience 
                involving the confusion when someone “rises above” his or her presumed station. What do readers gain from hearing about Wilkerson’s 
                personal experiences in addition to her deep historical research?</li>
            <li>“Indians will ask one’s surname, the occupation of one’s father, the village one is from, the section of the village that one is from, 
                to suss out the caste of whoever is standing in front of them,” Wilkerson writes. “They will not rest until they have uncovered the 
                person’s rank in the social order.” How is this similar to and different from the process of determining caste in America? </li>
            <li>It is a widely held convention that working-class white Americans may often “act against their own interests” by opposing policies designed to 
                help the working class.</li>
            <li>Discuss how overt racism subtly transforms into unconscious bias. What are the ways that we can work to compensate for the unconscious biases 
                inherent in a caste system? How does the caste system take people who would otherwise be allies and turn them against one other?</li>
            <li>Wilkerson gives examples that range from the horrifying (lynching) to the absurd (the Indian woman who walked across an office to ask a 
                Dalit to pour her water from the jug next to her desk) to illustrate caste’s influence on behavior. How do both of these types of examples—and 
                everything in between—help cement her points? Why do we need to see this range to clearly understand caste?</li>
            <li>Wilkerson describes dinner with a white acquaintance who was incensed over the treatment they received from the waitstaff. Why did the 
                acquaintance respond the way that she did, and how did it hurt or help the situation?</li>

    <p><a href="https://hclib.bibliocommons.com/v2/record/S109C4464887"><i>The Warmth of Other Suns</i></a> is Isabel Wilkerson's powerful oral history of 
        The Great Migration- the decades of the 20th century when millions of 
        African-Americans left the Deep South in the hopes of finding better social and
        economic opportunities in Northern and Western cities.

    <p>In <i>Caste</i>, Isabel Wilkerson uses the metaphor of a dormant Siberian virus to explain 
        the concept of caste. In <a href="https://hclib.bibliocommons.com/v2/record/S109C6308116"><i>The Viral Underclass,</i></a> 
        Journalist and Professor Steven Thrasher makes the case that the COVID-19 virus, like HIV, 
        affected the less well-off more significantly than the those with more privilege. 
        The better-off can often work safely from home, more directly and more seriously 
        than those with greater privilege. The experience of the members of this "viral 
        underclass" reveals deep fractures in our society. This work invites readers to consider 
        viruses as a component of caste in America as well as a metaphor that explains it.
