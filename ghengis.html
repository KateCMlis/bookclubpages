        <p>Format: book</p>
        <p>Genre: Biography, History, Asian Studies</p>
        
        <p> The name Genghis Khan often conjures the image of a relentless, bloodthirsty barbarian on horseback leading a ruthless 
            band of nomadic warriors in the looting of the civilized world. But the surprising truth is that Genghis Khan was a 
            visionary leader whose conquests joined backward Europe with the flourishing cultures of Asia to trigger a global awakening, 
            an unprecedented explosion of technologies, trade, and ideas. In Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World, Jack 
            Weatherford tracks the astonishing story of Genghis Khan and his descendants, and their conquest and transformation of the world.
        </p> 
            
        <p> Fighting his way to power on the remote steppes of Mongolia, Genghis Khan developed revolutionary military strategies and 
            weaponry which he then brilliantly used to overwhelm opposing armies in Asia, 
            break the back of the Islamic world, and render the armored knights of Europe obsolete. With an empire that stretched from Siberia to India, from Vietnam to Hungary, and from Korea to the Balkans, 
            the Mongols connected disparate kingdoms into a new world order.
        </p>
            
        <p> But contrary to popular wisdom, Weatherford reveals that the Mongols were not just masters of conquest, but possessed a genius for progressive and 
            benevolent rule. On every level and from any perspective, the scale and scope of Genghis Khan’s accomplishments challenge 
            the limits of imagination. Genghis Khan was an innovative leader. The trade routes he created became lucrative pathways for commerce, but also for ideas, 
            technologies, and expertise that transformed the way people lived. The Mongols were the architects of a new way of life at a pivotal time in history.
            This dazzling work of revisionist history doesn’t just paint an unprecedented portrait of a great leader and his legacy, but challenges 
            us to reconsider how the modern world was made.

                <b>ABOUT JACK M. WEATHERFORD</b>
                <p>
                    Professor Emeritus Weatherford is a cultural anthropologist who taught Anthropology at Macalester starting in 1983. 
                    He graduated from the University of South Carolina in 1967, with a B.A. in Political Science followed by a M.A. in Sociology in 1972. 
                    He also received a M.A. in Anthropology in 1973 and a Ph.D in Anthropology from the University of California, San Diego. 
                    He went on to post-doctoral work in the Institute of Policy Sciences at Duke University. Dr. Weatherford has worked with 
                    contemporary groups in places such as Bolivia and the Amazon with emphasis on the role of tribal people in world history.
                </p>
                
                <p> 
                    In recent years, he has concentrated on the Mongols. His book Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World was an 
                    international best seller published in more than twenty languages. In 2007 President Enkhbayar of Mongolia awarded 
                    him the Order of the Polar Star, Mongolia’s highest national award, in recognition of his contribution to Mongolian culture. 
                    His most recent work, <i>The Secret History of the Mongol Queens</i>, is the first book written on the daughters of 
                    Genghis Khan. The year 2012 was the 850th anniversary of the birth of Genghis Khan, and to honor that anniversary, 
                    the Mongolian President’s office sent audio book recordings of Weatherford’s books, Genghis Khan and the Making of 
                    the Modern World and <i>The Secret History of the Mongol Queens</i> to be played at all Mongolia’s sacred places from the 
                    eastern to the western border. The project took four months.

        <h2 class="headerstyle">Discussion Questions</h2>
        <ol class="question-list">
            <li>Jack Weatherford writes extensively about the environment and landscape of Mongolia
                both at the time Genghis Khan was alive, during various historical periods after his death,
                and today. How do these descriptions of landscape contribute to the history Weatherford is telling?
                Have you encountered other historical accounts that feature environment and landscape?</li>
            <li>The book includes a discussion of how Josef Stalin was especially interested in locating and 
                taking possession of Genghis Khan's spirit banner. What is a spirit banner, and why was it so important
                to the Soviet leadership to find it? Are there objects that are valued by governments today?
                What are they, and what purpose do they serve to nations or governments?</li>
            <li>Weatherford argues that the Mongol empire made it possible for the modern world as we know it to
                exist. Does this argument agree with or contradict history as you were taught it in school? Does it change
                your perspective on Europen history?</li>
            <li>How does the book explain the success of the Mongol empire? Is it more important in Weatherford's analysis
                that the Mongols were capable of forming and sustaining am effective military, or that they were able to 
                rule subjugated political and social entities?</li>
            <li>One recurring question in histories is whether exceptional individuals or the culture, context
                and specific circumstances of a particular moment in time that shape the course of history. In your opinion, 
                does Weatherford's book support one side of this question over another?</li>
